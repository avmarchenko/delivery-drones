# Monitoring Delivery Drone Proximity in Real Time
This is a project that mimics setting up a cloud computing
infrastructure for processing real time streaming data from
(fictitious) delivery drones (e.g. package or food delivery).
Coordinate data is received by the system, processed on-the-fly
and save to a database. Some batch processes are performed
periodically on the database to determine aggregate statistics
about the drones.
