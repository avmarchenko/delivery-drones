# Real Time Monitoring of Delivery Drones
This project simulates location data (altitude, latitude, longitude) from 
delivery drones. The data is streamed to a data engineering pipeline that
calculates relative distances in (near) real time. Although focused on the
particular
This is a project that mimics setting up a cloud computing
infrastructure for processing real time streaming data from
(fictitious) delivery drones (e.g. package or food delivery).
Coordinate data is received by the system, processed on-the-fly
and save to a database. Some batch processes are performed
periodically on the database to determine aggregate statistics
about the drones.
